# Day 3 - Data Structures in Java

## Implemented Structures
- **BinaryTree**: Tree with nodes having left and right children, supports traversal.
- **BinarySearchTree (BST)**: Ordered binary tree where left < root < right.

## Time & Space Complexity
- BinaryTree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder):
  - O(n) time, O(h) space (h = height)
- BST:
  - Insert/Search/Delete: O(h), average O(log n), worst O(n)
  - Space: O(n)

## Usage Example
```bash
javac BinaryTree.java
java BinaryTree
```

## How to Run Tests
Each file includes a `main` method with sample usage.
